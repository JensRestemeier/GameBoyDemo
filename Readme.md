This is the Game Boy demo I sent to Rare as part of my job application.

I sent both a hacked cartridge and a CD with the source code:

During development I used the textool socket to quickly replace the Flash chip with a new version.

This needs "TASM", the Table-Assembler to compile. Since that doesn't run on Win64 I included a compiled binary: [gbdemo.gb](https://github.com/JensRestemeier/GameBoyDemo/blob/master/gbdemo.gb?raw=true)
